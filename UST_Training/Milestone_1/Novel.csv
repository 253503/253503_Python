story,Quite a long time ago, there lived two talking birds with their parents. One day when their parents were away, a villager who generally had an eye on those special birds caught them and took them away. One of the birds got away from the trap and looked for his parents. The bird, at last, arrived at a hermitage where it was welcomed and had some food. He lived joyfully.
An explorer once ran over the other bird that the villager caught. He talked very rudely to him. He was shocked to see a talking bird but at the same time was angry with his way of behaving. The explorer visited the hermitage and recognised a similar talking bird, yet this bird talked respectfully and welcomed him to remain there.
